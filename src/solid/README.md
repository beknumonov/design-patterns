We'll explore and understand the SOLID principles with detailed code examples.
These principles form a set of five key design guidelines in object-oriented programming and software design. Their primary goal is to enhance software clarity, flexibility, and maintainability by promoting a structured approach to development.
The five principles are:
1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
   Let's dive in and explore each principle in detail! ðŸš€
   Here's a rephrased explanation of the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) along with the corresponding bad and good code examples in Java.
